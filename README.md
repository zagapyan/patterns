# NOTEWORTHY SNIPPETS
This is a document of noteworthy snippets of code patterns that I find either interesting, important, or relevant. All these patterns are ones that I find all over the web or in publications.

## [PUB/SUB](pubsub.js)
This is a pub/sub pattern. Pubs are events that are triggered or `published` and subs detect events or `subscribe` to events to which pubs have published.
